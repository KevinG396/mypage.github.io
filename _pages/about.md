I'm a second year Master's student of [Stream Based Super Computing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu) in Washington University in St. Louis, major in Computer Engineering & Electrical Engineering. I'm interested in `AI Methods` (Especially Bayesian Problems) and `System For AI` (Especially AI Inference on General Processors)
